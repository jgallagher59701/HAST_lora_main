Set up opertation of the unit tests involves some less than obvious
things.

The unit tests that do not build and download code to a MCU are tests
that run in the 'native' environment. I only have 'native' tests now.
To build code in this env, the 'native' env must be installed:

    pio platform install native

The tests are written liks just about any set of unit tests. Look in
this directory.

However, for tests to work with a local library (one in the 'lib'
directory), that library needs a 'library.json' file. Look at the code
in lib/soil_sensor_common to see how that library is organized and how
the library.json file describes the lib. The regular compile commands
don't (seem to) need this library.json file, but the tests do.

To run the tests:

    pio test -e native [-v]

Note that to build the code you use 'pio run,' so the tests build &
run with a different command and that might explain why on needs the
library.json file and the other doesn't...

To clean the library code:

    pio run -t clean -e native

Options long versions:

-t is --target
-e is --environment
-v is --verbose

To get the version info about platformio:

    pio --version
